                                    <p>My (full) name is <b>Bartlomiej Jozef Chrzaszcz</b>. Before I was born, my family decided to move to the US. I was born in Chicago Illinois and then moved to Burlington Ontario. I attended a very small elementary school and also a small highschool named Assumption Catholic Secondary School.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> In Grade 7, I started to have an interest in <b>trading securities</b> from seeing my older brother stay up all night trading currencies. I've been casually trading for the past couple of years. I've mostly used technical analysis and recently fiddled with statistical arbitrage strategies and their algorithms like Pair Trading.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> In regards to high school academics, I thoroughly <b>enjoyed mathematics</b>. In my 4 years in high school during which I took 5 Advanced Placement (and Pre-Advanced Placement) Math courses, I was able to maintain a 100% final average in each one. I also enjoyed many of my other classes and as a result, I graduated receiving the <b>Governor General's Academic Bronze Medal</b>.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> Finally, in regards to computer science, I never took CS classes in highschool but instead have <b>been teaching myself CS</b> since the Summer of 2015. I started out with Python during which I built small text-based adventure games, and then moved on to HTML5, CSS, and JS for web development using <a class="textLink" href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/">freeCodeCamp</a>. Also, I used Python in building some of my Raspberry Pi projects. I got into CS at the University of Waterloo and intend to joint major in statistics. After completing my undergrad, I hope to get a Masters or PhD in a field in math or CS and go on and either work in software development or become a quant in New York.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> Currently, I have trouble considering myself a coder. Many of my projects, including this website, has flaws that can be found within seconds by real coders and web designers/developers. But by constantly practising, building upon what I've learned, and staying up until 5 in the morning trying to figure out why something won't center, I'll be able to truly consider myself a <b><u>coder</u></b>.
